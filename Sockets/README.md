# Server
Simple program that creates a Socket where a Client can be connected to.

## How to run it
* Open a terminal to get into the *Server* folder and type **cargo run**.
This will create the Socket in localhost and port 9099.

* Then use another terminal to get into the *Client* folder and type **cargo run**. This will make a connection to the preoviously created Socket.

* Write anything you want in the Client program and it will be reprinted in the Server.

* To finish, simply write **bye** in the Server. Now the connection will be finished.
