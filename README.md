# Simple Algorithms and Codes

This is the repository where I put the code I practice Rust with.

Each folder contains a different problem and an explanation of it.

Some are my best solution to internet page problems. Others are famous models that I found interesting.

It should be noted that not all of them are finished, but they will be soon.

Thanks for browsing.
